		https://github.com/wildcatjayhawk/DATA-824/blob/8570be3b709d00c9ac24bbda15ff832db9372171/Final_Application.R

# 2. Launch R Studio 

# 3. Open the downloaded file with R Studio. It should automatically read it as an application into R. 

# 4. Make sure all libraries listed at top of the .R file are installed
	
	Any non-installed applications can be installed via the command:
		
			> install.packages("PackageName")
			
	Where, PackageName is the name of the library you are missing. 
		
# 5. Run the application within R Studio by either clicking the "Run" icon or by selecting all the code and pressing "cmd + enter". 

# 6. The application should download the source files from Github needed for the data analysis, and any related dependencies. If not, consider downloading the .csv data file found on Github and reading the data in manually from you local workspace. 

# 7. The application will launch into a broswer if deployed successfully where all inputs and controls are accessed there. 

# 8. Enjoy and let me know of any issues!
