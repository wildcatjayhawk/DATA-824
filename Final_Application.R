                   and over reactions causing difficulty in short-term trading and investing, 
                   and is the primary reason most financial literature for individuals suggest 
                   only viewing the market in a long term perspective. However, hedge funds,

                   combination of subjective assessment of the market via technical indicators 
                   and sentiment in addition to macro level influences that affect global markets.
